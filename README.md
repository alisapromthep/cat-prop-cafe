# Cat Prop Cafe

Cat Prop Cafe, is a gamify learning tool for learning React Prop. Personally, props was confusing when I first started, but with the help of flow charts it really helped put things in perspective for me. I wanted to create this to not only visualize react components as rooms in a cafe, but also using cats as props that can go from one room to another. (following some rules of course)
